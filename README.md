# Orbifolds in Lean

This project aims to formalise some of the basic theory of orbifolds and other generalised smooth spaces in lean. A first goal is to develop the theory of diffeological spaces to a point where orbifolds can be defined and reasoned about as special diffeological spaces; after that the focus will probably shift more towards proving theorems about orbifolds, or maybe even building up a theory of Lie groupoids to the point where orbifolds can be defined in terms of them too.

So far this is mostly following Patrick Iglesias-Zemmour's book "Diffeology" - I will list more references here when I use them. The API is also in large parts adapted from mathlib's topology API, since there is a lot of similarities at least in the basic theory.
