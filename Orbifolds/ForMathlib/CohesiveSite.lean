# Cohesive sites
Cohesive sites are sites with a number of useful properties that make their sheaf topos into
a cohesive topos. See https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive+site.

Every cohesive site is in particular local and locally connected, and every cosifted category
with a terminal object that admits morphisms to every object is cohesive when equipped with
the trivial topology.
